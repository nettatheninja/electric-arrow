# Hindsight

Hindsight is a curious concept by Netta Selene.

Starting out your career in the creative field can be fun and exciting, but with that comes loads of new experiences, questions, and inevitable mistakes to be made. Whenever I get emails in my inbox from fresh creatives asking for advice, I often respond with things I would tell my younger self as I was just starting out. Iâ€™ve been wanting to find a way to spread this at a broader level to other new creatives, so I spun up Hindsight.
